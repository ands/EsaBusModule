# EsaSpeedSwitch

There are 3 speed settings LOW (20 km/h), MEDIUM (25 km/h) and HIGH (30 km/h) and the option to enable/disable the immobilizer lock.
If you use the original hardware, the max. speed after power on is always 20 km/h, so you have to set a new speed every time.
A successful change of speed is shown by switching to eco mode for a short time (green LED lights up).
You can not change the speed limit of the eco mode though. This will always remain at 15 km/h.

- fully depress and hold throttle and brake for 3 seconds = 20 km/h

- 5x button presses and throttle lightly depressed => 25 km/h
- 5x button presses and throttle fully depressed => 30 km/h

- 4x button presses and brake fully depressed = enable lock mode
- 6x button presses and brake lightly depressed = disable lock mode
