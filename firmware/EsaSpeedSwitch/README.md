# EsaSpeedSwitch

There are 3 speed settings LOW (20 km/h), MEDIUM (25 km/h) and HIGH (30 km/h) and the option to enable/disable the immobilizer lock.
If you use the original dashboard and motor controller, the max. speed after power on is always 20 km/h, so currently you have to configure your speed after each power up.
A successful change of speed is shown by the green ECO mode LED blinking once (this is actually achieved by switching to eco mode for a short amount of time).
You can not change the speed limit of the ECO mode though. This will always remain at 15 km/h.

Inputs:
- Fully depress and hold throttle and brake for 3 seconds => 20 km/h
- 5 button presses and throttle lever lightly depressed => 25 km/h
- 5 button presses and throttle lever fully depressed => 30 km/h

- 4 button presses and brake lever fully depressed => enable lock mode
- 6 button presses and brake lever lightly depressed => disable lock mode
